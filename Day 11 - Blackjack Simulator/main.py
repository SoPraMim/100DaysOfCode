    ## The deck is unlimited in size. 
    ## There are no jokers. 
    ## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
    ## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
    ## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
    ## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
    ## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
    ## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
    ## The computer is the dealer.
